This will be us building a meal tracking application.

Using several iterations of reacty stuff

V1 - Plain ol' way you've always done it. Don't look at too many best practices just do it the dumb ol' way

Structure the project and install react essentially from scratch without using any external packages like CRA
Firebase backend for the moment to keep things super simple. Keep everything decoupled from the frontend as much as is possible

V2 - Introduce hooks, context and more up to date react workflows
V3 - Try one with Next.js and build out more of the feature level things
V4 - Learn more about styling the components better with Tailwind
V5 - Learn more dynamic styling with either Emotion or just SASS
V6 - Integrate a GraphQL
V7 - Add on typescript and type safety to see what kind of problems it addresses/ introduces


The APP itself

A basic meal planning crud application

1) Meals
2) Foods
3) Recipes
4) Ingredients

Eventually a drag and Drop kind of interface where you're assembling meals out of ingredients

But for now just a master interface of having CRUD for meals, ingredients, recipes and food
